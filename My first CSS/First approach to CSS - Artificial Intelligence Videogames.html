            For video game fans, the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) is just as familiar as extra 
            lives, respawns, and end bosses. Gamers have spent decades going up against computer-controlled 
            opponents, whether a Pong paddle trying to prevent them from scoring a point or Bowser trying 
            to stop Mario from rescuing Princess Peach. But recent developments in AI are pushing the 
            gaming field even further, as researchers develop algorithms that can help fans make exciting 
            new titles on their own.

            The history of AI and that of gaming are inexorably intertwined. Early AI researchers saw games 
            like chess as markers of intelligence, and thus perfect testing grounds for their work. “One 
            of the very earliest things that people tried to do with this sort of burgeoning field was get 
            it to play chess and get to play chess well, and, obviously, <a href="https://time.com/3705316/
            deep-blue-kasparov/">that eventually happened with Deep Blue</a>,” says Matthew Guzdial, an AI 
            researcher and assistant professor at the University of Alberta. Contemporary AI researchers 
            have focused on more complex games, particularly the 
            <a href="https://time.com/4196275/google-deepmind-ai-go/">ancient Chinese game of Go</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            As AI research moved into the subfield of machine learning — in which algorithms are “taught” 
            how to learn on their own — video games emerged as a similarly suitable testbed. “A game is 
            fully observable in a way that much of the real world isn’t,” says Guzdial. “Most importantly, 
            it has rewards. It has a notion of ‘you are doing well’ or ‘you are doing badly.’ Building up 
            those kinds of functions in life is extremely complicated.” In Super Mario Brothers, for instance,
            a player knows they’re doing poorly when they take damage or lose a life. They know they’re doing 
            well when they finish a level, defeat enemies, or earn coins. That kind of feedback is key for 
            training machine learning algorithms.
        </p>

            Of course, simply playing a game is one thing. What about creating them, the way 
            <a href="https://time.com/collection/life-reinvented/5774723/ai-music/">some musicians are using 
            AI</a> to generate entirely new forms of their art? Guzdial and his team are working on exactly 
            that. They’re developing software that, working alongside human partners, creates new video games 
            out of whole cloth.

            To train an AI to build its own Super Mario Bros.-style platforming games, for instance, Guzdial 
            and his team had the software “watch” hours of videos showing people playing that game, as well 
            as similar titles, like Mega Man and Kirby’s Adventure. After binge-watching gaming videos on 
            YouTube and elsewhere, their software guesses at the rules of the games, then it checks its 
            guesses by watching the videos once more. With the rules of a game sorted out, Guzdial’s 
            algorithms follow a similar procedure to create new levels in which the rules are put to work.

            “Once we’ve learned both of these bits, we put them into this common representation — basically 
            squash these two sets of knowledge together into this big representation — we call it a game 
            graph,” Guzdial says. “And you can think of this as this dense tangled web of information about 
            a game. But importantly, it has all the information you need to basically reproduce the game.”
