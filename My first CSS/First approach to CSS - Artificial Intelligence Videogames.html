            For video game fans, the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) is just as familiar as extra 
            lives, respawns, and end bosses. Gamers have spent decades going up against computer-controlled 
            opponents, whether a Pong paddle trying to prevent them from scoring a point or Bowser trying 
            to stop Mario from rescuing Princess Peach. But recent developments in AI are pushing the 
            gaming field even further, as researchers develop algorithms that can help fans make exciting 
            new titles on their own.
        </p>
        <p>
            The history of AI and that of gaming are inexorably intertwined. Early AI researchers saw games 
            like chess as markers of intelligence, and thus perfect testing grounds for their work. “One 
            of the very earliest things that people tried to do with this sort of burgeoning field was get 
            it to play chess and get to play chess well, and, obviously, <a href="https://time.com/3705316/
            deep-blue-kasparov/">that eventually happened with Deep Blue</a>,” says Matthew Guzdial, an AI 
            researcher and assistant professor at the University of Alberta. Contemporary AI researchers 
            have focused on more complex games, particularly the 
            <a href="https://time.com/4196275/google-deepmind-ai-go/">ancient Chinese game of Go</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            As AI research moved into the subfield of machine learning — in which algorithms are “taught” 
            how to learn on their own — video games emerged as a similarly suitable testbed. “A game is 
            fully observable in a way that much of the real world isn’t,” says Guzdial. “Most importantly, 
            it has rewards. It has a notion of ‘you are doing well’ or ‘you are doing badly.’ Building up 
            those kinds of functions in life is extremely complicated.” In Super Mario Brothers, for instance,
            a player knows they’re doing poorly when they take damage or lose a life. They know they’re doing 
            well when they finish a level, defeat enemies, or earn coins. That kind of feedback is key for 
            training machine learning algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, simply playing a game is one thing. What about creating them, the way 
            <a href="https://time.com/collection/life-reinvented/5774723/ai-music/">some musicians are using 
            AI</a> to generate entirely new forms of their art? Guzdial and his team are working on exactly 
            that. They’re developing software that, working alongside human partners, creates new video games 
            out of whole cloth.
        </p>

        <p>
            To train an AI to build its own Super Mario Bros.-style platforming games, for instance, Guzdial 
            and his team had the software “watch” hours of videos showing people playing that game, as well 
            as similar titles, like Mega Man and Kirby’s Adventure. After binge-watching gaming videos on 
            YouTube and elsewhere, their software guesses at the rules of the games, then it checks its 
            guesses by watching the videos once more. With the rules of a game sorted out, Guzdial’s 
            algorithms follow a similar procedure to create new levels in which the rules are put to work.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Once we’ve learned both of these bits, we put them into this common representation — basically 
            squash these two sets of knowledge together into this big representation — we call it a game 
            graph,” Guzdial says. “And you can think of this as this dense tangled web of information about 
            a game. But importantly, it has all the information you need to basically reproduce the game.”
        </p>
        <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G1Md-wqh1vk" 
        frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; 
        picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>
            Finally, to generate its own games, the team’s software looks at all the information in this 
            “game graph.” Then it begins to design, combine, and reproduce what it saw. In one example, 
            Guzdial says the AI took the platforming styles of Mega Man and Super Mario Bros. and combined 
            them to create something new. “Now imagine that happening over and over and over again for every 
            piece of level design for every piece of game rule logic,” he says. That could result in entirely 
            new AI-generated games — experiences similar to what gamers know and love, but novel enough 
            to be notably different. Because Guzdial’s work is academic in nature, it’s protected under 
            fair use, and thus isn’t likely to run afoul of copyright laws.
        </p>
        <p>Guzdial says his goal isn’t to replace game creators. Instead, he’s hopeful his work can reduce 
            the barrier of entry around game creation. “The plan was always to use this to help people make 
            games,” he says. Using a tool like his, he says, a gamer could start building their own levels 
            without learning how to write code. Other level-building tools, like Nintendo’s Super Mario 
            Maker, are already big hits with fans. “It allows the user to basically define the set of rules 
            that the AI has learned without having to explicitly know anything about coding,” he says.
        </p>
        <p>
            Up next for Guzdial is a tool that could let gamers bored of their current selection to instantly 
            build an entirely new game simply by deciding how they want their game to look and feel. The 
            AI could then take that input and design a game, complete with rules and levels. All the software 
            would need, he says, are two frames worth of data, defined by the player. “And as soon as we 
            have more than one frame, the AI system learns rules that would explain the difference between 
            the two frames,” he says. The AI makes predictions, the creator gives feedback, and the AI makes 
            adjustments. At the end of this back and forth, Guzdial says, a gamer would have something brand 
            new to enjoy. “We’re putting some finishing touches on the interface and then we’re going to run 
            a human subject study to find out if we’re on the right track,” he says.
       </p>

        A practical consumer version of that technology is still likely years away. The industry may be slow 
        to adopt it, too, nervous about software outmoding human game designers. Guzdial thinks that 
        independent developers will likely be the trailblazers who make the first compelling games using 
        tools like his. He <a href="https://lizfiacco.itch.io/lab-assistant" target="_blank"> pointed to Lab 
        Assistant</a>, a machine learning-based game in which a player has to teach language to a mysterious 
        ooze in order to solve puzzles. “I can totally imagine that what we get are some passionate indie 
        [developers] messing around with these technologies and making weird, cool, interesting little 
        experiences,” he says. “But I don’t think they’re going to impact triple-A game development anytime 
        soon.”
