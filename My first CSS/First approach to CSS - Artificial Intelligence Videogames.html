                <p title="First Paragraph">
                    For video game fans, the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) is just as familiar as extra 
                    lives, respawns, and end bosses. Gamers have spent decades going up against computer-
                    controlled opponents, whether a Pong paddle trying to prevent them from scoring a point or 
                    Bowser trying to stop Mario from rescuing Princess Peach. But recent developments in AI are 
                    pushing the gaming field even further, as researchers develop algorithms that can help fans 
                    make exciting new titles on their own.
                </p>
                <p title="Second Paragraph">
                    The history of AI and that of gaming are inexorably intertwined. Early AI researchers saw 
                    games like chess as markers of intelligence, and thus perfect testing grounds for their work. 
                    “One of the very earliest things that people tried to do with this sort of burgeoning field 
                    was get it to play chess and get to play chess well, and, obviously, 
                    <a href="https://time.com/3705316/deep-blue-kasparov/" target="_self" title=
                    "Another Technology Time's News">that eventually happened with Deep Blue</a>,” says Matthew 
                    Guzdial, an AI researcher and assistant professor at the University of Alberta. Contemporary 
                    AI researchers have focused on more complex games, particularly the 
                    <a href="https://time.com/4196275/google-deepmind-ai-go/" target="_self" title=
                    "Google Strikes Again with some innovative AI dev">ancient Chinese game of Go</a>.
                </p>
                <p title="Third Paragraph">
                    As AI research moved into the subfield of machine learning — in which algorithms are “taught” 
                    how to learn on their own — video games emerged as a similarly suitable testbed. “A game is 
                    fully observable in a way that much of the real world isn’t,” says Guzdial. “Most importantly, 
                    it has rewards. It has a notion of ‘you are doing well’ or ‘you are doing badly.’ Building up 
                    those kinds of functions in life is extremely complicated.” In Super Mario Brothers, for 
                    instance, a player knows they’re doing poorly when they take damage or lose a life. They know 
                    they’re doing well when they finish a level, defeat enemies, or earn coins. That kind of 
                    feedback is key for training machine learning algorithms.
                </p>
                <p title="Fourth Paragraph">
                    Of course, simply playing a game is one thing. What about creating them, the way 
                    <a href="https://time.com/collection/life-reinvented/5774723/ai-music/" target="_self" title=
                    "AI in the Music Industry">some musicians are using AI</a> to generate entirely new forms of 
                    their art? Guzdial and his team are working on exactly that. They’re developing software that,
                    working alongside human partners, creates new video games out of whole cloth.
                </p>

                <p title="Fifth Paragraph">
                    To train an AI to build its own Super Mario Bros.-style platforming games, for instance, 
                    Guzdial and his team had the software “watch” hours of videos showing people playing that 
                    game, as well as similar titles, like Mega Man and Kirby’s Adventure. After binge-watching 
                    gaming videos on YouTube and elsewhere, their software guesses at the rules of the games, 
                    then it checks its guesses by watching the videos once more. With the rules of a game sorted 
                    out, Guzdial’s algorithms follow a similar procedure to create new levels in which the rules 
                    are put to work.
                </p>
                <p title="Sixth Paragraph">
                    “Once we’ve learned both of these bits, we put them into this common representation — 
                    basically squash these two sets of knowledge together into this big representation — we call 
                    it a game graph,” Guzdial says. “And you can think of this as this dense tangled web of 
                    information about a game. But importantly, it has all the information you need to basically 
                    reproduce the game.”
                </p>
                <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G1Md-wqh1vk" 
                frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; 
                picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p title="Seventh Paragraph">
                    Finally, to generate its own games, the team’s software looks at all the information in this 
                    “game graph.” Then it begins to design, combine, and reproduce what it saw. In one example, 
                    Guzdial says the AI took the platforming styles of Mega Man and Super Mario Bros. and combined 
                    them to create something new. “Now imagine that happening over and over and over again for 
                    every piece of level design for every piece of game rule logic,” he says. That could result 
                    in entirely new AI-generated games — experiences similar to what gamers know and love, but 
                    novel enough to be notably different. Because Guzdial’s work is academic in nature, it’s 
                    protected under fair use, and thus isn’t likely to run afoul of copyright laws.
                </p>
                <p title="Eighth Paragraph">
                    Guzdial says his goal isn’t to replace game creators. Instead, he’s hopeful his work can 
                    reduce the barrier of entry around game creation. “The plan was always to use this to help 
                    people make games,” he says. Using a tool like his, he says, a gamer could start building 
                    their own levels without learning how to write code. Other level-building tools, like 
                    Nintendo’s Super Mario Maker, are already big hits with fans. “It allows the user to basically
                    define the set of rules that the AI has learned without having to explicitly know anything 
                    about coding,” he says.
                </p>
                <p title="Ninth Paragraph">
                    Up next for Guzdial is a tool that could let gamers bored of their current selection to 
                    instantly build an entirely new game simply by deciding how they want their game to look and 
                    feel. The AI could then take that input and design a game, complete with rules and levels. 
                    All the software would need, he says, are two frames worth of data, defined by the player. 
                    “And as soon as we have more than one frame, the AI system learns rules that would explain 
                    the difference between the two frames,” he says. The AI makes predictions, the creator gives 
                    feedback, and the AI makes adjustments. At the end of this back and forth, Guzdial says, a 
                    gamer would have something brand new to enjoy. “We’re putting some finishing touches on the 
                    interface and then we’re going to run a human subject study to find out if we’re on the right 
                    track,” he says.
                </p>
                <p title="Tenth Paragraph">
                    A practical consumer version of that technology is still likely years away. The industry may 
                    be slow to adopt it, too, nervous about software outmoding human game designers. Guzdial 
                    thinks that independent developers will likely be the trailblazers who make the first 
                    compelling games using tools like his. He <a href="https://lizfiacco.itch.io/lab-assistant" 
                    target="_blank" title="A puzzle game called Lab Assistant">pointed to Lab Assistant</a>, a 
                    machine learning-based game in which a player has to teach language to a mysterious ooze in 
                    order to solve puzzles. “I can totally imagine that what we get are some passionate indie 
                    [developers] messing around with these technologies and making weird, cool, interesting little 
                    experiences,” he says. “But I don’t think they’re going to impact triple-A game development 
                    anytime soon.”
