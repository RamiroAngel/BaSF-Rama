                <p title="First Paragraph">
                    <span class="bigf">F</span>or video game fans, the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) is just as familiar as 
                    extra lives, respawns, and end bosses. Gamers have spent decades going up against 
                    computer-controlled opponents, whether a Pong paddle trying to prevent them from scoring 
                    a point or Bowser trying to stop Mario from rescuing Princess Peach. But recent 
                    developments in AI are pushing the gaming field even further, as researchers develop 
                    algorithms that can help fans make exciting new titles on their own.
                </p>
                <p title="Second Paragraph">
                    The history of AI and that of gaming are inexorably intertwined. Early AI researchers saw 
                    games like chess as markers of intelligence, and thus perfect testing grounds for their 
                    work. “One of the very earliest things that people tried to do with this sort of 
                    burgeoning field was get it to play chess and get to play chess well, and, obviously, 
                    <a href="https://time.com/3705316/deep-blue-kasparov/" target="_self" title=
                    "Another Technology Time's News">that eventually happened with Deep Blue</a>,” 
                    says Matthew Guzdial, an AI researcher and assistant professor at the University of 
                    Alberta. Contemporary AI researchers have focused on more complex games, particularly the 
                    <a href="https://time.com/4196275/google-deepmind-ai-go/" target="_self" title=
                    "Google Strikes Again with some innovative AI dev">ancient Chinese game of Go</a>.
                </p>
                <p title="Third Paragraph">
                    As AI research moved into the subfield of machine learning — in which algorithms are 
                    “taught” how to learn on their own — video games emerged as a similarly suitable testbed. 
                    “A game is fully observable in a way that much of the real world isn’t,” says Guzdial. 
                    “Most importantly, it has rewards. It has a notion of ‘you are doing well’ or ‘you are 
                    doing badly.’ Building up those kinds of functions in life is extremely complicated.” In 
                    Super Mario Brothers, for instance, a player knows they’re doing poorly when they take 
                    damage or lose a life. They know they’re doing well when they finish a level, defeat 
                    enemies, or earn coins. That kind of feedback is key for training machine learning 
                    algorithms.

                    Of course, simply playing a game is one thing. What about creating them, the way

                    title="AI in the Music Industry">some musicians are using AI</a> to generate entirely 
                    new forms of their art? Guzdial and his team are working on exactly that. They’re 
                    developing software that, working alongside human partners, creates new video games out 
                    of whole cloth.

                <p title="Fifth Paragraph">
                    To train an AI to build its own Super Mario Bros.-style platforming games, for instance, 
                    Guzdial and his team had the software “watch” hours of videos showing people playing that 
                    game, as well as similar titles, like Mega Man and Kirby’s Adventure. After binge-watching 
                    gaming videos on YouTube and elsewhere, their software guesses at the rules of the games, 
                    then it checks its guesses by watching the videos once more. With the rules of a game 
                    sorted out, Guzdial’s algorithms follow a similar procedure to create new levels in which 
                    the rules are put to work.
                </p>
                <p title="Sixth Paragraph">
                    “Once we’ve learned both of these bits, we put them into this common representation — 
                    basically squash these two sets of knowledge together into this big representation — 
                    we call it a game graph,” Guzdial says. “And you can think of this as this dense tangled 
                    web of information about a game. But importantly, it has all the information you need to 
                    basically reproduce the game.”
                </p>
                <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G1Md-wqh1vk" 
                frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; 
                picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p title="Seventh Paragraph">
                    Finally, to generate its own games, the team’s software looks at all the information in 
                    this “game graph.” Then it begins to design, combine, and reproduce what it saw. In one 
                    example, Guzdial says the AI took the platforming styles of Mega Man and Super Mario Bros. 
                    and combined them to create something new. “Now imagine that happening over and over and 
                    over again for every piece of level design for every piece of game rule logic,” he says. 
                    That could result in entirely new AI-generated games — experiences similar to what gamers 
                    know and love, but novel enough to be notably different. Because Guzdial’s work is academic 
                    in nature, it’s protected under fair use, and thus isn’t likely to run afoul of copyright 
                    laws.
                </p>
                <p title="Eighth Paragraph">
                    Guzdial says his goal isn’t to replace game creators. Instead, he’s hopeful his work can 
                    reduce the barrier of entry around game creation. “The plan was always to use this to help 
                    people make games,” he says. Using a tool like his, he says, a gamer could start building 
                    their own levels without learning how to write code. Other level-building tools, like 
                    Nintendo’s Super Mario Maker, are already big hits with fans. “It allows the user to 
                    basically define the set of rules that the AI has learned without having to explicitly know
                    anything about coding,” he says.
                </p>
                <p title="Ninth Paragraph">
                    Up next for Guzdial is a tool that could let gamers bored of their current selection to 
                    instantly build an entirely new game simply by deciding how they want their game to look 
                    and feel. The AI could then take that input and design a game, complete with rules and 
                    levels. All the software would need, he says, are two frames worth of data, defined by the 
                    player. “And as soon as we have more than one frame, the AI system learns rules that would 
                    explain the difference between the two frames,” he says. The AI makes predictions, the 
                    creator gives feedback, and the AI makes adjustments. At the end of this back and forth, 
                    Guzdial says, a gamer would have something brand new to enjoy. “We’re putting some 
                    finishing touches on the interface and then we’re going to run a human subject study to 
                    find out if we’re on the right track,” he says.
                </p>
                <p title="Tenth Paragraph">
                    A practical consumer version of that technology is still likely years away. The industry 
                    may be slow to adopt it, too, nervous about software outmoding human game designers. 
                    Guzdial thinks that independent developers will likely be the trailblazers who make the 
                    first compelling games using tools like his. He <a href=

                    learning-based game in which a player has to teach language to a mysterious ooze in 
                    order to solve puzzles. “I can totally imagine that what we get are some passionate indie 
                    [developers] messing around with these technologies and making weird, cool, interesting 
                    little experiences,” he says. “But I don’t think they’re going to impact triple-A game 
                    development anytime soon.”
